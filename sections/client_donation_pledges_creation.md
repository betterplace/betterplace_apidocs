# Creating a Client Donation Pledge ⇄ [Status](client_donation_pledge_status.md)

```Cirru
POST https://api.betterplace.org/de/api_v4/clients/volksfreund/projects/1114/donation_pledges.json
```

Submit a donation pledge into the system. This will be transformed into
a donation to the receiver. The request has to be a POST request with a
JSON body.

**:lock: Only available if authenticated as a client.**
See [betterplace.org clients](../README.md#client-api).


### Process Flow

[This flow chart describes the process…](https://ixwphj.axshare.com/donation-pledge-flow.html).


### What if the donation receiver is fully funded?

The donation will be booked in the receiver account even
if the receiver is fully funded. The receiver will than show a
progress percentage > 100 %. For a project that means, the project
manager has to add new money needs to pay out the additional funds.

Please note that a closed project is prohibited from receiving donations.


### What if the donation receiver is prohibited from receiving donations?

At the time when the pledge is received the system does not check the receiver
status. Therefore the API will always respond with a success message for all
receivers. Should the receiver be prohibited from receiving donations at the
time when the donation is processed, the donation will be redirected to a
specific client donation pool. Clients can later forward this money to
projects they choose.


### Reconciliation of donation pledges

Part of the contract for the usage of this donation pledge API will
be the time period in which the pledges need to be reconciled. Ususally
every two weeks or once a month. At the end of this time, the client
will sum all pledges in the client system, wire us the donations and
also send us a CSV file which allows betterplace.org to check the amounts.

The fields for the CSV files are:
- receiver_type, eg. `Project`
- receiver_id, eg. `1114`
- amount_in_cents, eg. `12000`
- client_reference, eg. `123123123123`
- datetime (ISO8601 with Timezone), eg `2007-11-01T13:15:30Z`

Please use these names as column titles, use utf-8, use ","
as a separator and force double quotes around all values.

Here is [a flow chart describing the process](https://ixwphj.axshare.com/money-transfer-flow.html).


### Sending donation pledges to the client-pool

It is possible to send donation pledges directly to the client-pool, by
submitting to this endpoint instead of the project specific one:

`POST https://api.betterplace.org/de/api_v4/clients/{CLIENT}/pool/donation_pledges.json`

This endpoint will respond and behave like described above, but the
money will be stored on the pool. Clients can later forward this money to
projects they choose.


### Response and error codes:

[A list of all response and error codes](../README.md#http-status-codes).

The most likely ones are:

[HTTP Code **`202`**](http://httpstatus.es/202)
if a resource was successfully submitted for delayed processing.
A successful request will return HTTP status 202 (accepted). The
donation pledge is now saved and queued and will be processed
by background workers. This part takes place asynchronously and might
take up to a few minutes, especially in high traffic scenarios.
Please make sure that you queue and retry your API calls until you
receive clear answer (202, 422, 404, etc.) from us.
Note that we will book only one
donation per <code>client_reference</code> so there's no need to
worry about retrying the pledge-sending.

[HTTP Code **`422`**](http://httpstatus.es/422)
if the submitted resource could not be accepted due to erroneous parameters.
Please remember to validate all user input on your side before submitting
it to the API.

[HTTP Code **`404`**](http://httpstatus.es/404)
if a requested resource could not be found. This might happen if
the resource has been deleted in the timeframe between selection by the
user and confirmation of the pledge by the client. In this case, either
contact your user and change the resource (most likely a project) or
redirect the donation to the client pool (the URL is provided by
betterplace.org).
