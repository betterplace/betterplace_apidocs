# The betterplace.org API Version 4

This is the latest API for betterplace.org. It's a REST-style API that returns
JSON for serialization.
It incorporates some ideas from [hypermedia APIs](https://www.google.de/search?q=hypermedia+api)
such as the link structure.

### **Organisation API**

1. [ThirdPartyApp custom donation form for organisations](donation_form/third_party_app_donation_form.md)

## General information

* The API is https only, all non-https requests will be redirected accordingly
* The response format is JSON
* We support [Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), so no proxy or JSONP is required
* Authentication: Most API calls are public.
  Some client API features require authentication. [Learn more](#client-authentication)
* The data of betterplace Users is not part of the API at this moment.


### Request parameter format

The `order` and `facets` request parameters accept multiple key-value pairs.
We use the same convention as the [Google Static Maps API V2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#URL_Parameters).

Example: `foo:bar|lorem:ipsum`

This way you may specify a primary and secondary sort order such as
`order=rank:DESC|created_at:DESC`, which will cause higher ranked objects to
come first and more recently created objects to come first if they have equal
rank.

* Split key and value by a colon `:`
* Split multiple key-value pairs by a pipe `|` (`%7C`)
* [URL-encode](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL-Encoding) all params, so the pipe becomes `%7C`
* Note that for readability reasons we don't URL-encode the params in this documentation


### Addressing the locale of a resource
* Some resources offer translated content. To access the translated content you
  need to set the lang-prefix in the API URL.
  `api_v4/de/projects/…` returns the German translations while
  `api_v4/en/projects/…` return the English ones. Non-translated
  content will fall back to the original content language.
  We currently support content with German and English translations.
* The same pattern applies to creating resources for a specific language.


### Pagination

All list requests can be paginated with the following parameters.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Default</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>page</code></td>
    <td>Used to paginate through the list</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>per_page</code></td>
    <td>The number of entries per page</td>
    <td>20</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The <code>per_page</code> parameter is capped at 200. Any higher value for <code>per_page</code> grants at most 200 results.

The following attributes are returned in all list view responses:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>total_entries</code></td>
    <td>Count of all entries</td>
    <td>23</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>offset</code></td>
    <td>The number of entries that are skipped before the current listing begins, <code>= max(page - 1, 0) * per_page</code></td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>total_pages</code></td>
    <td>Count of all pages, based on <code>per_page</code></td>
    <td>42</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>current_page</code></td>
    <td>What page we are on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>per_page</code></td>
    <td>Number of entries per page</td>
    <td>20</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Sanitization

Every string attribute returned in a JSON document is sanitized HTML. By
default only ```a, b, br, em, i, li, ol, p, strong, ul``` tags are allowed.
If an attribute allows for a different set of tags it is specified in the
documentation of this field under the "Response Attributes" headline.
We might adapt the allowed this set of tags at any time without further notice,
e.g. to avert upcoming security problems.


### Picture formats

Please note that all over the API only the `original` image version will always
be available. There are additional image versions for various entities, e.g.
fill_960x500 for projects. You can use these versions, but they might change in
the future!

To avoid problems, stay tuned and subscribe to the [Mailing list for service
announcements ↑](#mailing-list-for-service-announcements).


### HTTP Status Codes

The following HTTP result codes can be returned:

* [HTTP Code `200`](http://httpstatus.es/200)
  if all is good and
  [HTTP Code `304`](http://httpstatus.es/304)
  if this good thing has not been modified (based on ETag).
* [HTTP Code `201`](http://httpstatus.es/201)
  if a resource was created successfully.
* [HTTP Code `202`](http://httpstatus.es/202)
  if a resource was successfully submitted for delayed processing.
* [HTTP Code `400`](http://httpstatus.es/400)
  if a requested resource could not be created or updated,
  if the submitted data was invalid.
* [HTTP Code `401`](http://httpstatus.es/401)
  if a resource requires [client authentication](#client-authentication)
  but the authentication failed.
* [HTTP Code `403`](http://httpstatus.es/403)
  if a resource requires [client authentication](#client-authentication)
  but no client was authenticated.
* [HTTP Code `404`](http://httpstatus.es/404)
  if a requested resource could not be found.
  Also used for projects that are not part of a given client scope.
* [HTTP Code `422`](http://httpstatus.es/422)
  if the submitted resource could not be accepted due to erroneous parameters.
* [HTTP Code `500`](http://httpstatus.es/500)
  if a software error on the server was encountered.
* [HTTP Code `503`](http://httpstatus.es/503)
  if the server is unavailable due to high load.


### Error Messages

If an error occurs, a JSON response message is returned with a `name` and `reason` (optional).
Clients that use the betterplace.org staging environment will also see a
`backtrace` and `message` property.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "GeneralError",
  "status": "not_found",
  "status_code": 404,
  "reason": "Record Not Found",
  "backtrace": [
    "/path/to/file:23:in 'method'",
    "/path/to/file:42:in 'method2'"
  ],
  "message": "Couldn't find Project with id=666",
  "links":[]
}
```

If errors occur during the creation process of a resource, the answer will
contain helpful information about how to resolve the issue. Please note
that this information is not meant to be used in your application directly
but only for your development process. We might change the specs for the
error response at any time without further notice.

Example with validation errors:

```json
{
  "name": "GeneralError",
  "status": "unprocessable_entity",
  "status_code": 422,
  "reason": "Cannot Process Submitted Data",
  "backtrace": [
    "/path/to/file:23:in 'method'",
    "/path/to/file:42:in 'method2'"
  ],
  "message": "First name Dies ist ein Pflichtfeld",
  "errors": { "first_name": [ "Dies ist ein Pflichtfeld." ] },
  "links":[]
}
```

### Known issues

Please contact developers@betterplace.org for more information

* Documentation: Not all resources have a documentation URL as part of the JSON response
* Documentation: The response table does not show the root documentation for response elements with sub-elements (for example carrier.name is documented but carrier is not)
* BlogPosts: There is no way yet to filter BlogPosts from PayoutBlogPosts


### API Client Libraries

While we currently do not offer any official client API libraries, [Duilio Ruggiero](https://github.com/sinetris) implemented the prototypical ruby client [bettery](https://github.com/sinetris/bettery).

We would love to hear from you if you plan to use/extend bettery or implement your own client and publish the code.


### Code examples

* [Using the API with PHP](https://gist.github.com/svjv1160/7749784)
* [WordPress Plugin by freifunk](https://github.com/freifunk/www.freifunk.net/tree/master/wp-plugins/betterplace-project-table) which [shows the freifunk projects as a table](http://spenden.freifunk.net)
* _Please send us your code examples to developers@betterplace.org_


### Example apps

* "Deutsch-Tansanische Partnerschaft e.V." uses this API to present their betterplace.org projects right on their website: [Project list](http://www.dtpev.de/unterstuetzen/projekte), [Project details](http://www.dtpev.de/unterstuetzen/projekte/one-child-one-light)
* ["Förderverein Freie Netzwerke e.V."](http://foerderverein.freie-netzwerke.de/spenden/) uses this API to present their betterplace.org projects right on their website.
* ["Alfred-Kunze-Sportpark"](http://alfred-kunze-sportpark.de/teilziele.php) uses this API to present all needs for their one betterplace.org project right on their website.
* ["Earthship Tempelhof"](http://www.earthship-tempelhof.de/#spenden) uses this API to embed our integrated donation form (iframe) alongside information about the project status.
* _Please send us your sites to developers@betterplace.org_


## Client API

This API provides special features for companies and organisations as
part of the services offered by our [betterplace solutions](http://www.betterplace-solutions.de).
This client access requires a special contract.
Please [contact us](http://www.betterplace-solutions.de)
with your questions.


### Client Projects

Clients projects are projects on betterplace.org
that are associated with an api client
as part of the services that betterplace.org provides for companies.
This way clients can control what projects are visible on their external platform.

Some URLs have a special scope for clients. Examples:

* `/clients/example_client/projects`
  will only show projects of the client "example_client"
* `/clients/example_client/tags/rainforest/projects`
  will only show projects of the client "example_client" that are tagged with "rainforest".

If you request data for a project that is not part of the client
projects, the API will return an HTTP error code `404`.


### Client Volunteering Offers

Clients volunteering offers are volunteering offers on betterplace.org
that are associated with an api client
as part of the services that betterplace.org provides for companies.
This way clients can control what volunteering offers are visible on their external platform.

It works the same way as with projects, see above (["Client Projects"](#client-projects)).


### Client Authentication

Some features of the betterplace.org client API require your authentication.

* Please use your API Credentials to authenticate with [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side) username and password.
* Please use the special scope for clients that is described [above](#client-projects).

Username, password and client scope are provided as part of a contract with our
[betterplace solutions](http://www.betterplace-solutions.de/#buergerzeitung).


### Usage example

The local German newspaper "Trierischer Volksfreund"
has its own donation portal at ["Meine Hilfe zählt"](http://www.meine-hilfe-zaehlt.de/).
All data is pulled from this API. They also use the betterplace.org
whitelabel donation form, which is another service betterplace.org provides for clients.


## API V1, V2, V3

betterplace.org has three deprecated APIs. For more information contact product@betterplace.org.
